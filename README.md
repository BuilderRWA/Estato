# Estato


An innovative Real World Assets (RWA) initiative that aims to tokenize Ukrainian buildings and real estate properties, bringing them onto the blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, we provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way for investors worldwide to invest in Ukrainian real estate. This approach democratizes access to property investment, reduces barriers to entry, and contributes to the economic development of Ukraine.
